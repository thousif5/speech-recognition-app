# speech-recognition-app
### This is just a basic browser assistant which recognizes user's speech and does some minimal operations
### Steps to use
#### By clicking on microphone icon the microphone gets activated and you can speak any following commands

- If you speak 'open + {any website}' it will open the respective website in new tab (* not all websites only popular sites like YouTube, Google, Instagram, Amazon, Gmail, Netflix etc.)
Other than this if you speak 'open + {any new website}' it will open the google search results in new tab.

- If you speak 'search + {any keyword}' it will open the google search results in new tab.

- If you ask Date or Time it will display the current date, time (* in 24 hours format) and the respective timezone.

Other than this if you try speaking any random phrases or words it will just display whatever you speak.

Couple of other features are in development, those will be added soon.

Thank You
